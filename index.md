### About Me

- I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at Auburn University, advised by [Prof. Shubhra Kanti Karmaker](https://karmake2.github.io/).

- My research interests lie in the general area of machine learning, particularly in natural language processing, as it applies to helping make tools that can provide unique insights and new possibilities.

- I received my Bachelor's and Master's Degree from Georgia Institute of Technology in Civil Engineering and Computer Science.
